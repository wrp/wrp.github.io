Raad a little bit about fossil (https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki)
today.  After reading many discussions, it seems that the fossil developers fundamentally
do not understand rebase.  It may be possible to have a work flow using git for
development and the importing to fossil, and I may explore that since I really like
the idea of keeping everything in sqlite instead of git's approach.  But it seems
that fossil is not going to be suitable replacement.
