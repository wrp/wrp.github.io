I recently discovered that people are using the word "interpretable" to
describe software.  Curious about this new usage of the word, I asked
GPT for some clarity and got:

~~~
Readable

Readable code is easy to read — that is, the syntax, structure, and naming make it clear what the code is doing at a surface level.
It emphasizes clarity.

Readability = syntactic and stylistic clarity.

Examples of what affects readability:

Consistent indentation and formatting

Clear variable and function names

Logical ordering of code

Minimal cognitive overhead to follow control flow

Avoiding unnecessary cleverness or obfuscation

Readable code lets someone scan a function and follow the flow without getting lost in syntax or naming confusion.

Interpretable

Interpretable code is easy to understand conceptually — that is, someone can determine why it behaves the way it does, and what it means in the larger context.
It emphasizes semantic clarity and intent.

Interpretability = semantic and conceptual clarity.

Examples of what affects interpretability:

Well-chosen abstractions that match domain concepts

Meaningful architecture and decomposition

Comments that explain why something is done, not what

Code that aligns with expected mental models or business logic

Interpretable code lets someone understand the reasoning behind it — not just follow its syntax.
~~~

I fundamentally disagree.  This definition of "interpretable" is *exactly* what people have always meant by "readable".
Or, at least, it is what I have always meant!  Are other people using the word differently than I am?
I suppose it is good to have this new word to use to mean exactly what
the old word has alway meant, as it may provide additional clarity to
new users, but ... get off my lawn!
