I recently had the pleasure of reading through a selection
of commits from the sympy repository.  The output I saw:

~~~

I am publishing this output to provide an example of
how *not* to write a commit message.  Those summaries
are (almost) completely meaningless.  I can see that 'mod'
is being changed, and I can tell that some commits are (probably)
only changing some tests, but for the most part these commit
summaries are utterly and completely useless.  When you write
a commit message, you must convey information.  What does the
commit do?  Include meta-data like the issue being changed
in the trailers, not in the summary, and *never* write
a commit message like "Merging changes"!!  The whole point
of the commit summary is to allow a reader to have a high
level view of how the commit changes the repository.  For all
of those commits, that information is missing.  To gather
than information, the commit must be inspected.
