Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a great idea.   But are you practicing
it?  If you are comitting hundreds (or thousands) of lines of
boilerplate across hundreds (or thousands!) of files to a git
repository, you are not practicing IaC.  Writing software is a
craft.  "Code" is more than just text files that are stored in a
VCS.  "Code" is a way of thinking. "Code" is a mindset.  It requires
appropriate abstractions and minimal redundancy.  Every piece of
information has a single source of truth, and every line of code
should have a meaningful purpose.  There are many mantras and
guidelines but most boil down to an emphasis on readability, elegance,
and simplicity.  If your IaC is not readable, simple, and elegant,
then it's not "code".  If it's not code, then it cannot be
"infrastructure as code".  It is merely configuration in git.

Look at your templates, and ask yourself if you are practicing
"infrastructure as code" or if you merely have "configuration in git".
If you have the latter (and 95% of you do, but I'm only giving the
5% because I am an incurable optimist and I believe someone out
there must be doing things properly), what do you need to do to change
it?
