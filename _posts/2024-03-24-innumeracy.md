I just read an article about the current stock market.  I will not provide
a link to because there is no reason to shame the author.  The general
premise of the article was "The stock market is so HOT right now!  The
S&P is up 10.25% this quarter, which puts us on track for a 41% annual
return!".

No.  How is it that someone writing an article on the stock market
does not even grasp the basic concept of compound interest?  Although
10.25 * 4 is indeed 41, that is not the relevant calculation.
The relevant calculation is $`1.1025^4 \approx 1.478`$, and a 10.25% return
every quarter is a 47.8% annual return.  I have to assume that people are
not completely ignorant, so perhaps the author is "dumbing down" the
article for the audience.
